# Cross Connection
The PSVITA tools do not have the ability to perform operations simultaneously via FTP and USB. I have created something that will certainly serve the PSVITA scene but especially to users who have Henkaku Enso. The application in question is called Cross Connection and allows use the 2 transfer methods to transfer your files from the PC to the console both in FTP mode and in USB mode at the same time. You will then be able to transfer your files in USB mode to the ux0: partition and in FTP mode to um0: or ur0: or vice versa without waiting for one of them to terminate.The tool can also be used in "mono" mode, only FTP or USB only, obviously depends on your use. Finally thank the Onelua Team, the code used is a large part of them and the ONELua interpreter.
